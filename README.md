## Hi there 👋 I'm Sofia ✨

 - 🏥 I currently work as a __Front End Developer__ in e-healthcare.
 - 🌱 I’m currently learning: __C#, Unity__ and __Blender__.
 - 🌈 I also love design!
 - 👩🏻‍⚕️ I have a Nursing Degree, I'm a Specialist Nurse and have worked as such for 12 years!
 - 💥 I'm __curious__ and eager to learn new skills.
 - ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a VR games addict!
